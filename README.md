Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report Overview This project entails conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to extract insights, comprehend distributions, recognize patterns, and identify anomalies. The analysis emphasizes understanding the behavior of numerical features through statistical summaries and visual techniques. Steps Undertaken 1. Summary Statistics Key descriptive statistics were generated to grasp the central tendency and dispersion of each numerical variable, including: Mean Median Standard Deviation Minimum and Maximum These statistics offer a concise overview of the data distribution and potential outliers. 2. Data Visualization: Histograms & Boxplots Histograms were constructed to illustrate the frequency distribution of numerical features. These visualizations assisted in identifying: Skewed distributions Potential outliers Range and spread of each variable 3. Feature Relationships: Pairplot & Correlation Matrix Pairplots (scatterplot matrix) were employed to visualize relationships and interactions among features. A Correlation Matrix (Heatmap) was developed to ascertain the strength and direction of linear relationships between numerical features. This phase facilitated the discovery of: Strongly correlated features Redundant variables Possible predictors for modeling 4. Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies Through the visuals and statistics: Patterns and groupings within the data were observed. Outliers and anomalies were identified using boxplots and z-scores. Trends across multiple variables were inferred using scatterplot grids. 5. Basic Inferences Based on the visual analysis: Features exhibiting high variability were flagged for potential normalization. Correlated features were selected for feature engineering or dimensionality reduction. Skewed variables were identified for potential transformation. Conclusion The EDA process yielded essential insights into the structure and quality of the dataset. These insights will facilitate subsequent preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development steps.
